[00:00.00]Leonardo da Vinci had the good luck to be born out of wedlock. Otherwise,he would have been expected to become a notary, like the firstborn legitimate sons in his family stretching back at least five generations. 
[00:24.32]His family roots can be traced to the early 1300s, when his great-greatgreat-grandfather,Michele, practiced as a notary in the Tuscan hill town of Vinci, about seventeen miles west of Florence.
[00:38.22]I With the rise of Italy?s mercantile economy, notaries played an important role drawing up commercial contracts, land sales, wills, and other legal documents in Latin,often garnishing them with historical references and literary flourishes.
[00:53.51]Because Michele was a notary, he was entitled to the honorific ?Ser? and thus became known as Ser Michele da Vinci. His son and grandson were even more successful notaries, the latter becoming a chancellor of Florence.
[01:07.99]The next in line, Antonio, was an anomaly. He used the honorific Ser and married the daughter of a notary, but he seems to have lacked the da Vinci ambition. He mostly spent his life living off the proceeds from family lands,tilled by sharecroppers, that produced a modest amount of wine, olive oil, and wheat.
[01:29.11]Antonio?s son Piero made up for the lassitude by ambitiously pursuing success in Pistola and Pisa, and then by about 1451, when he was twenty-five,establishing himself in Florence. A contract he notarized that year gave his work address as ?at the Palazzo del Podestï¿½,?
[01:49.63]the magistrates? building (now the Bargello Museum) facing the Palazzo della Signoria, the seat of government. He became a notary for many of the city?s monasteries and religious orders, the town?s Jewish community, and on at least one occasion the Medici family.
[02:06.69]On one of his visits back to Vinci, Piero had a relationship with an unmarried local peasant girl, and in the spring of 1452 they had a son.Exercising his little-used notarial handwriting, the boy?s grandfather Antonio recorded the birth on the bottom of the last page of a notebook 
[02:26.97]that had belonged to his own grandfather. ?1452: There was born to me a grandson,the son of Ser Piero my son, on the 15th day of April, a Saturday, at the third hour of the night [about 10 p.m.]. He bears the name Leonardo.?
[02:45.86]Leonardo?s mother was not considered worth mentioning in Antonio?s birth notation nor in any other birth or baptism record. From a tax document five years later, we learn only her first name, Caterina. Her identity was long a mystery to modern scholars. She was thought to be in her mid-twenties, and some researchers speculated that she was an Arab slave, or perhaps a Chinese slave.
[03:12.45]In fact, she was an orphaned and impoverished sixteen-year-old from the Vinci area named Caterina Lippi. Proving that there are still things to be rediscovered about Leonardo, the art historian Martin Kemp of Oxford and the archival researcher Giuseppe Pallanti of Florence produced evidence in 2017 documenting her background.
[03:35.47]Born in 1436 to a poor farmer, Caterina was orphaned when she was fourteen. She and her infant brother moved in with their grandmother, who died a year later, in 1451. Left to fend for herself and her brother, Caterina had a relationship in July of that year with Piero da Vinci, then twenty-four, who was prominent and prosperous.
[03:58.84]There was little likelihood they would marry. Although described by one earlier biographer as ?of good blood,?5 Caterina was of a different social class,and Piero was probably already betrothed to his future wife, an appropriate match: a sixteen-year-old named Albiera who was the daughter of a prominent Florentine shoemaker.
[04:21.21]He and Albiera were wed within eight months of Leonardo?s birth. The marriage, socially and professionally advantageous to both sides, had likely been arranged, and the dowry contracted, before Leonardo was born.
[04:35.70]Keeping things tidy and convenient, shortly after Leonardo was born Piero helped to set up a marriage for Caterina to a local farmer and kiln worker who had ties to the da Vinci family. Named Antonio di Piero del Vaccha, he was called Accattabriga, which means ?Troublemaker,? though fortunately he does not seem to have been one.
[04:59.04]Leonardo?s paternal grandparents and his father had a family house with a small garden right next to the walls of the castle in the heart of the village of Vinci. That is where Leonardo may have been born, though there are reasons to think not.
[05:14.84]It might not have been convenient or appropriate to have a pregnant and then breast-feeding peasant woman living in the crowded da Vinci family home, especially as Ser Piero was negotiating a dowry from the prominent family whose daughter he was planning to marry.
[05:31.17]Instead, according to legend and the local tourist industry, Leonardo?s birthplace may have been a gray stone tenant cottage next to a farmhouse two miles up the road from Vinci in the adjacent hamlet of Anchiano, which is now the site of a small Leonardo museum.
[05:49.77]Some of this property had been owned since 1412 by the family of Piero di Malvolto, a close friend of the da Vincis. He was the godfather of Piero da Vinci and, in 1452, would be a godfather of Piero?s newborn son, Leonardo?which would have made sense if Leonardo had been born on his property. The families were very close.
[06:12.33]Leonardo?s grandfather Antonio had served as a witness to a contract involving some parts of Piero di Malvoto?s property. The notes describing the exchange say that Antonio was at a nearby house playing backgammon when he was asked to come over for that task. Piero da Vinci would buy some of the property in the 1480s.
[06:32.63]At the time of Leonardo?s birth, Piero di Malvoto?s seventy-year-old widowed mother lived on the property. So here in the hamlet of Anchiano,an easy two-mile walk from the village of Vinci, living alone in a farmhouse that had a run-down cottage next door, was a widow who was a trusted friend to at least two generations of the da Vinci family.
[06:55.42]Her dilapidated cottage (for tax purposes the family claimed it as uninhabitable) may have been the ideal place to shelter Caterina while she was pregnant, as per local lore.Leonardo was born on a Saturday, and the following day he was baptized by the local priest at the parish church of Vinci. The baptismal font is still there.
[07:20.74]Despite the circumstances of his birth, it was a large and public event.There were ten godparents giving witness, including Piero di Malvoto, far more than the average at the church, and the guests included prominent local gentry. A week later, Piero da Vinci left Caterina and their infant son behind and returned to Florence, where that Monday he was in his office notarizing papers for clients.
[07:54.62]Leonardo left us no comment on the circumstances of his birth, but there is one tantalizing allusion in his notebooks to the favors that nature bestows upon a love child. ?The man who has intercourse aggressively and uneasily will produce children who are irritable and untrustworthy,? he wrote, 
[08:15.39]?but if the intercourse is done with great love and desire on both sides, the child will be of great intellect, witty, lively, and lovable.?8 One assumes, or at least hopes, that he considered himself in the latter category.
[08:30.56]He split his childhood between two homes. Caterina and Accattabriga settled on a small farm on the outskirts of Vinci, and they remained friendly with Piero da Vinci. Twenty years later, Accattabriga was working in a kiln that was rented by Piero, and they served as witnesses for each other on a few contracts and deeds over the years.
[08:53.04]In the years following Leonardo?s birth,Caterina and Accattabriga had four girls and a boy. Piero and Albiera,however, remained childless. In fact, until Leonardo was twenty-four, his father had no other children. (Piero would make up for it during his third and fourth marriages, having at least eleven children.)
[09:14.70]With his father living mainly in Florence and his mother nurturing a growing family of her own, Leonardo by age five was primarily living in the da Vinci family home with his leisure-loving grandfather Antonio and his wife. 
[09:29.56]In the 1457 tax census, Antonio listed the dependents residing with him, including his grandson: ?Leonardo, son of the said Ser Piero, non legittimo, born of him and of Caterina, who is now the woman of Achattabriga.?
[09:47.69]Also living in the household was Piero?s youngest brother, Francesco, who was only fifteen years older than his nephew Leonardo. Francesco inherited a love of country leisure and was described in a tax document by his own father,in a pot-calling-the-kettle way, as ?one who hangs around the villa and does nothing.?
[10:07.88]He became Leonardo?s beloved uncle and at times surrogate father. In the first edition of his biography, Vasari makes the telling mistake,later corrected, of identifying Piero as Leonardo?s uncle.
