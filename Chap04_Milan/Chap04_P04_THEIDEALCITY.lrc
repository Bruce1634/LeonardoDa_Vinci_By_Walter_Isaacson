[00:00.00]Near the end of his job application to Ludovico Sforza, Leonardo touted himself as someone who could ?be the equal of any other in architecture and the composition of buildings.? But for his first few years in Milan, he had trouble getting any such commissions. So for the time being, he pursued his architectural interests the way he did his military interests: mainly on paper as imaginative visions never to be implemented.
[00:30.28]The best example was his set of plans for a utopian city, which was a favorite subject for Italian Renaissance artists and architects. Milan had been ravaged in the early 1480s by three years of the bubonic plague, which killed close to one-third of its inhabitants. With his scientific instincts, Leonardo realized that the plague was spread by unsanitary conditions and that the health of the citizens was related to the health of their city.
[00:58.12]He did not focus on marginal improvements in engineering and design. Instead, on multiple pages composed in 1487, he proposed a radical concept, one that combined his artistic sensibilities with his visions as an urban engineer: the creation of entirely new ?ideal cities? planned for health and beauty. 
[01:21.50]The population of Milan would be relocated to ten new towns, designed and built from scratch along the river, in order to ?disperse its great congregation of people which are packed like goats one behind the other, filling every place with fetid smells and sowing seeds of pestilence and death.?
[01:41.51]He applied the classic analogy between the microcosm of the human body and the macrocosm of the earth: cities are organisms that breathe and have fluids that circulate and waste that needs to move. He had recently begun studying blood and fluid circulation in the body. Thinking by analogy, he considered what would be the best circulation systems for urban needs, ranging from commerce to waste removal.
[02:09.57]The glory of Milan was that it had an ample water supply and a long tradition of channeling the flow of mountain streams and melting snows. Leonardo?s idea was to combine the streets and canals into a unified circulation system. The utopian city he envisioned would have two levels: an upper level designed for beauty and pedestrian life, and a level hidden below for canals, commerce, sanitation, and sewage.
[02:36.89]?Let only that which is good looking be seen on the upper level of the city,? he decreed. The wide streets and arcaded walkways on this level would be reserved for pedestrians and be flanked by beautiful homes and gardens. Unlike the cramped streets of Milan, which Leonardo realized led to the spread of disease, the boulevards in the new town would be at least as wide as the height of the houses. 
[03:02.00]To keep these boulevards clean, they would be sloped to the middle to allow rainwater to drain through central slits into a sewer circulation system below. These were not merely general suggestions; Leonardo got very specific. ?Each road must be 20 braccia wide and have ï¿½ braccio slope from the sides towards the middle,? he wrote, ?and in the middle let there be at every braccio an opening, one braccio long and one finger wide, where the rain water may run off into hollows.?
[03:32.14]The lower level, beneath the visible surface, would have canals and roads for deliveries, storage areas, alleys for carts, and a sewerage system to carry away refuse and ?fetid substances.? Homes would have main entries on the upper level and tradesmen?s entrances on the lower level, which would be lit by air shafts and connected to the upper level ?at each arch by a winding stair.? 
[04:02.32]He specified that these stairs should be spiral, both because he loved that form and because he was a fastidious man. Corners provided a place for men to urinate. ?The corners of square ones are always fouled,? he wrote. ?At the first vault there must be a door entering into public privies.? Once again he delved into the details: ?The seat of the latrine should be able to swivel like the turnstile in a convent and return to its initial position by the use of a counterweight. The ceiling should have many holes in it so that one can breathe.?
[04:36.73]As with so many other of Leonardo?s visionary designs, he was ahead of what was practical for his time. Ludovico did not adopt his vision of the city, but in this case Leonardo?s proposals were sensible as well as brilliant. If even part of his plan had been implemented, it might have transformed the nature of cities, reduced the onslaught of plagues, and changed history.
